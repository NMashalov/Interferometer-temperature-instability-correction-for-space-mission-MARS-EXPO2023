## Abstract

The present study focuses on the radiometric calibration of the FAST instrument (Fourier Spectrometer for Atmospheric Studies of Mars). The principles of Fourier spectroscopy are outlined, followed by a sequential examination of radiometric calibration techniques. To illustrate the practical application of calibration techniques, experimental setups involving FAST are presented, and their results are analyzed. Additionally, the paper provides a description of approaches to the design of Fourier spectrometers and modifications to the classical Michelson interferometer.

## Tools

Paper was done with use of Tex and [Template](https://github.com/yl3dy/mipt-thesis) for my university. 

## Data

Statistical inference was based on mechanics of infrared interferometers and spectrographic equation. Paper has detailed explanation of approach.
